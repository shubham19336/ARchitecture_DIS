# ARchitecture_DIS

With this app, architects and builders can show their designs and plans
for various buildings to their clients. Architects usually make blueprints and 3D models to convey their idea of design.
But through the means of this app, they can present their design to the users through an augmented reality experience. 
 
First find a flat surface and when a 3D marker appears tap on it.
And Voila! The design of the building will apear. This is a design of a 1bhk building

The users can take full toor of the building and can experience it as if they were in it.
The user can also step out of the house and visualize it from outside.

Inside the house the users can interact with the app through some functionalities. By tapping on the toggle button the users
can see various options to interact. They can change the colour theme of the house using a colour picker with as much 
saturation as they like. The users can also move some items within the building to see if it works for them. In this way
the users can have an immersive experience of the whole design of the building.
